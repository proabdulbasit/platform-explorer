Data contracts form the foundation of dash platform blockchain's data management capabilities, defining the structures and rules for how data can be created, read, updated, and deleted.  

Each data contract provides detailed information on schemas, permissible operations, and historical interactions, ensuring transparency and reliability.

On the data contract page you can find the structure of the data contract, owner [Identity](/identities), creation [transaction](/transactions) and the list of documents created based on the data contract.
