A transaction in the blockchain context represents an action initiated by a participant within the network. This action could involve the transfer of assets, updating data, or executing smart contracts. Transactions are the core operations that enable the blockchain to function as a decentralized ledger.

Transactions can be of various types:

- **[Data Contracts](/dataContracts) create and update:** [Data Contracts](/dataContracts) define the schema and rules for data storage, enabling structured and managed data within the blockchain.

- **Documents batch:** Operations with documents, can include the creation, updating, or deletion of documents.

- **[Identities](/identities) create, update, top up, transfer, and withdrawal**
